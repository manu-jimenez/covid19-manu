# Coronavirus COVID-19

This repository contains a simple (and short) exploratory data analysis focused on the pandemic crisis caused by the coronavirus COVID-19.

The aim is to show the evolution of the reported cases, deaths and recovered using the information of the new daily (cases, deaths or recovered), their cumulative sum and their variation rate (daily and cumulative).

Data is automatically extracted from the official source (epdata.es) when the user runs the notebook. After the processing stage, data with the calculated metrics is saved in the directory *data_output*.
